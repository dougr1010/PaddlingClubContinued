# ImaginaryPaddlingClub - Continued

This is code for a paddling club website implemented using the MEAN stack.  It uses Passport to manage user access, MongoDB to store user, trip, and message information, and ng-file-upload and multer to upload and store external files. Logged in users get to request trip information, a page containing all their trip information, and a bulletin board style messaging system. Trip Leaders get a page to manage trip descriptions, attach documents and maps, and send trip information to those who request it. The public gets to see a description of the club and what it offers, a calendar of trips, and a description of each trip, and the option register an account or log on if they have an account already.

This repo is for further developments on the original project.
  - First step was to style using Bootstrap, so it is now responsive and works well for mobile and any screen size.
