# ImaginaryPaddlingClub

This is code for a paddling club website implemented using the MEAN stack.  It uses Passport to manage user access, MongoDB to store user, trip, and message information, and ng-file-upload and multer to upload and store external files. Logged in users get to request trip information, a page containing all their trip information, and a bulletin board style messaging system. Trip Leaders get a page to manage trip descriptions, attach documents and maps, and send trip information to those who request it. The public gets to see a description of the club and what it offers, a calendar of trips, and a description of each trip, and the option register an account or log on if they have an account already.

At this time, this website is not being used.  It may be in the future.
